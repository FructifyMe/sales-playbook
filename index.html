    <title>Unmind Nova - Interactive Sales Playbook</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Calm Harmony Neutrals" - A palette using a base of slate and stone neutrals (bg-slate-50, border-slate-200), with a professional and calming muted teal (teal-600/700) as the primary interactive color and a subtle amber (amber-500) for highlights and call-to-actions. This creates a focused, uncluttered, and sophisticated feel appropriate for a corporate strategy tool. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a task-oriented, single-page dashboard for a sales representative (JC). The structure avoids the linear format of the source report and instead prioritizes actionability and quick access to key information. It's organized into four logical sections: 1. **Market Pulse Dashboard:** An initial overview of the market opportunity (burnout crisis, investment trends) to provide context. 2. **Target Accounts Funnel:** An interactive, tabbed view of the tiered company lists (Tier 1, 2, 3) to allow for focused prospecting. 3. **Actionable Lead Board:** The core of the app, transforming the static CHRO table into a filterable, searchable grid of interactive cards. Clicking a card reveals a detailed dossier with contact info and a one-click "copy message" function. 4. **GTM Strategy:** A visual timeline of the go-to-market plan. This structure guides the user from high-level understanding to specific, actionable sales tasks, which is far more efficient for a sales workflow than reading a report. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Burnout rates by industry -> Goal: Compare high-need sectors -> Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Hover for details on burnout drivers -> Justification: Clearly visualizes the hierarchy of need, making prioritization intuitive.
        - Report Info: Corporate wellness market growth projection -> Goal: Show market viability -> Viz: Line Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Tooltips show value at data points -> Justification: Effectively communicates the growing budget allocation in the target market.
        - Report Info: Tiered company lists -> Goal: Organize target accounts -> Presentation: Tabbed interface with company cards -> Interaction: Click tabs to filter tiers -> Justification: Segments the target list cleanly, preventing information overload and allowing the user to focus on one tier at a time.
        - Report Info: Master CHRO list & Executive Dossiers -> Goal: Enable targeted outreach -> Presentation: Interactive modal with contact info and "copy to clipboard" buttons -> Interaction: Click lead card to open dossier, click buttons to copy email and tailored message -> Justification: This is the primary action-oriented feature. It dramatically reduces friction for the sales rep, moving them from research to outreach in a single click.
        - Report Info: Phased GTM plan -> Goal: Outline strategy -> Presentation: Visual timeline (HTML/CSS) -> Interaction: Static visual -> Justification: Transforms a text block into an easily digestible strategic roadmap.
        - Library/Method: All charts use Chart.js (Canvas). All other visuals and layouts use structured HTML and Tailwind CSS. -->
